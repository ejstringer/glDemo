## `r rproj()` Worked example

Let's try this out. In the code box below type

```{r, eval = FALSE}
possums.gl
```

and then click ![run code button](./images/learnr_run_code.png){height="1em"}.

```{r met_data, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r met_data-solution}
possums.gl
```

what does the output look like?
